# Introduction
This project aims to predict the prices of cars based on various features using advanced linear regression techniques. The goal is to create a reliable and accurate model that can be used to estimate car prices given the relevant data.

# Features
## Data preprocessing and cleaning
## Feature engineering
## Model training using advanced linear regression
## Model evaluation
## Visualizations of results
# Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
After installing the dependencies, you can start exploring and using the project. Here are some common tasks you can perform:

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset.
Feature Engineering: Create new features to improve the model's performance.
Model Training: Train the advanced linear regression model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using various metrics.
Running the Project
To run the project, execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This will preprocess the data, train the model, and output the evaluation results.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features such as car make, model, year, mileage, and more. You can download the dataset from here.

Make sure to place the dataset in the data directory.

# Model
The advanced linear regression model is implemented using Python's scikit-learn library. The model includes regularization techniques to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

# Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Visualizations of the predictions versus actual prices are also provided.
